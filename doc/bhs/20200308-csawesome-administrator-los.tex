Dear \csawesome\ Team,

I understand that David Petty is applying for \csawesome, a professional development course at the \href{https://www.csawesome.org/pathfinders}{Pathfinders Summer Institute 2020}. As \textit{Head of School} at \textit{Brookline High School}, I confirm my support for his participation.

As part of that support:\begin{itemize}
\item I will ensure that the \textit{Advanced Placement Computer Science A} course (including \csawesome) is placed in the 2020-2021 master school schedule. 
\item I confirm that David Petty has my approval to implement the \csawesome\ curriculum in his \textit{AP CS A} class at \textit{Brookline High School} during the 2020-2021 academic year.
%\item I understand that we are committing to participate in the \csawesome Research Project funded by Google. 
\item I will work with the \textit{Brookline High School} staff to ensure that the demographics of the class reflect the demographics of the entire school population, including a gender balance of female and male students.
\item I confirm that \textit{Brookline High School} has internet access and the necessary technology infrastructure to allow the implementation of \csawesome.
\end{itemize}
I am happy to respond to any questions about this letter of support.
